	Abstract = {Packrat parsing is a newly popular technique for efficiently implementing recursive descent parsers. Packrat parsing avoids the potential exponential costs of recursive descent parsing with backtracking by ensuring that each production rule in the grammar is tested at most once against each position in the input stream. This paper argues that (a) packrat parsers can be trivially implemented using a combination of definite clause grammar rules and memoing, and that (b) packrat parsing may actually be significantly less efficient than plain recursive descent with backtracking, but (c) memoing the recognizers of just one or two nonterminals, selected in accordance with Amdahl's law, can sometimes yield speedups. We present experimental evidence to support these claims.},

@mastersthesis{flodin2014packrat,
	Abstract = {Packrat parsing is a top-down, recursive descent parsing technique that uses backtracking and has a guaranteed linear parse time. Conventional backtracking parsers suffer from exponential parse times in the worst case due to re-evaluating redundant results. This is avoided in packrat parsers with the use of memoization. However, memoization causes packrat parsers memory consumption to be linearly proportional to the input string, as opposed to linearly proportional to the maximum recursion depth for conventional parsing techniques. The objective of this thesis is to implement a packrat parser generator and compare it with an existing and well-known parser combination called Lex/Yacc which produces shift-reduce parsers. The comparison will consist of pure performance measurements such as memory consumption and parsing time, and also a more general comparison between the two parsing techniques. The conclusion made from the comparison is that packrat parsing can be a viable option due to its ability to compose modular and extendible grammars more easily than Lex/Yacc. However, from a performance perspective the Lex/Yacc combination proved superior. In addition, the results indicate that similar performance for a packrat parser is hard to achieve on grammars similar to those used in this thesis. },

	Abstract = {Understanding and using Design Patterns improves software quality through better comprehension of programs for both experienced developers and relative novices. Often design patterns are learned through simplified ?toy? programs
and exemplars that foreground the structure of the pattern. In production code the objects and methods that comprise the
pattern can be hidden within a complex mesh of intra-code
relationships. This paper introduces APRT, an ANTLR-based
tool that recovers the structure of both static and dynamic
patterns from large codebases so that they can be studied in
context.},

The executable code it produces is proved to behave exactly as specified by the semantics of the source C program. This article gives an overview of the use of CompCert to gain certification credits for a highly safety-critical industry application, certified according to IEC 60880. We will briefly introduce the target application, illustrate the process of changing the existing compiler infrastructure to CompCert, and discuss performance characteristics. The main part focuses on the tool qualification strategy, in particular on how to take advantage of the formal correctness proof in the certification process.},

	Abstract = {Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs) describe top-down parsers. Unfortunately, the error-reporting techniques used in conventional top-down parsers do not directly apply to parsers based on Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs), so they have to be somehow simulated. While the PEG formalism has no account of semantic actions, actual PEG implementations add them, and we show how to simulate an error-reporting heuristic through these semantic actions. We also propose a complementary error reporting strategy that may lead to better error messages: labeled failures. This approach is inspired by exception handling of programming languages, and lets a PEG define different kinds of failure, with each ordered choice operator specifying which kinds it catches. Labeled failures give a way to annotate grammars for better error reporting, to express some of the error reporting strategies used by deterministic parser combinators, and to encode predictive top-down parsing in a PEG.},
