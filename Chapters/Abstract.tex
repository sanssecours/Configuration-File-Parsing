\begin{abstract}
Parsing – determining structure of input according to a language grammar – has been an important area of research in computer science for decades. One might assume that the results of this research, such as parser generators and parser libraries are prevalent, when a programmer decides to work with any computer language. However, this is not the case. Especially for custom and small languages, such as configuration file formats, people tend to write their own parsers often ignoring lessons learned before.
