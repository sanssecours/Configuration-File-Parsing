% Limitations: Only looked at YAML.
%              Additional parsing libraries in other languages might be better for parsing config data

% - To what extent you achieved your aims/objectives OR not: if not, why not?
% - How important and significant your results are, as well as any limitations of your research (e.g. small sample size; other variables)
% - Where the research should go from here: what are some interesting further areas to be explored based on what you have discovered or proven?

In the thesis we compared different parsing techniques using the \nameref{sec:keyset} structures of the configuration framework \href{https://www.libelektra.org}{Elektra} as common end product of the parsing process. The aim of this task was to find the most promising parsing technique for configuration files using the language \glstext{YAML} as example.
